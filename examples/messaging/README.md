# Example - Messaging

This examples shows how to use the basic messaging API by implementing a mocked
up request and response system.

## Setup

The `messaging.ino` file should work with the standard [Arduino IDE](https://www.arduino.cc/en/Main/Software). By default, we're assuming the
target device is an Arduino Due. You'll need to copy this repos `waggle`
directory in the project folder to build.

To run `messaging.py`, you'll need the [pywaggle module](https://github.com/waggle-sensor/pywaggle)
to be installed to run `messaging.py`.
